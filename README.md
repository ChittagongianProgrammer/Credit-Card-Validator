# Credit Card Validator in Python
This is code to validate credit card numbers using the Luhn algorithm checksum. Here is an explanation of how it works:

1. Get user input for the credit card number and store it in card_number

2. Clean up the input by removing any dashes or spaces

3. Reverse the card number string using [::1] slicing 

4. Sum all digits in odd positions (0-based indexing, so the 1st, 3rd, 5th etc digits) and store in odd_digit_sum

5. For the even position digits (2nd, 4th, 6th etc):
   a) Convert to int and multiply by 2 
   b) If this number is greater than 9, add the digits (e.g. 14 -> 1 + 4 = 5)  
   c) Sum these final digits after handling the double and store in even_digit_sum

6. Calculate total by adding odd_digit_sum and even_digit_sum

7. If total modulo 10 is 0, the number passes the checksum and is valid

8. Otherwise it fails the checksum and is invalid

So in summary:
- Reformat input 
- Get sums of odd and doubled-even digits 
- Check if total sum modulo 10 is 0

This uses the standard Luhn algorithm steps to validate the integrity of the card number by checking the checksum.
